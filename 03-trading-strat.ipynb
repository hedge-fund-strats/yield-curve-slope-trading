    "# PCA Strategy: Flatteners and Steepeners\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the PCA Var-Cov decomposition, we are going to conduct a strategy that is neutral to changes in the level of the curve (PC1 neutral), and delta neutral. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our PCA decompisition looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  F_t = \\Delta y_{t} E$$\n",
    "$$ \\Delta y_{t} = F_t E^T$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Delta y_t$ is $(n, m)$ matrix with $n =$ number of periods in-sample and $m$ maturities in our yield curve (30).\n",
    "- $F_t$ is the  $(n, f)$ matrix  of series of PCA scores, with $f$ number of factors to project (3 in our baseline case, ~97\\% variance explained)\n",
    "- $E$ $(f, m)$ matrix of eigenvectors of the decomposition of $\\Sigma$, i.e. the loading of each PCA factor of each maturity. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steepeners and Flatteners\n",
    "\n",
    "The two strategies that we will pursue are Steepeners and Flatteners:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steepener:\n",
    "    - Upward sloping curve: long front end /short long end \n",
    "- Flattener: \n",
    "    - Upward sloping curve: short front end /long long end\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose a set of pairs of shorter/longer rates, such as 2vs20, 6Mvs5Y, 3Mvs7Y and so on. Fot any of the pairs, we defined a portfolio with weights $w_1, w_2$ sufh that our portfolio for the $i$-th strategy $ i = 1,....,N$, $\\Pi^i_t$, is nuetral to $\\text{PCA}_1$ factor: \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We know that from the PCA decompositions $\\partial_{\\text{PCA}_1} \\Delta y^s_t = E_{(1, \\Delta y^j_t)}, j = s,l$, the respective loading from the eigenvectors. Furthermore, we restrict $w_1 + w_2 = 0$ or $w_1 = -w_2$ to have a delta nuetral portfolio.\n",

    "$$ w_1 E_{(1, \\Delta y^s_t)} + w_2 E_{(1, \\Delta y^l_t)} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we would like to have unit exposure to PCA2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_1 E_{(2, \\Delta y^s_t)} + w_2 E_{(2, \\Delta y^l_t)} = 1$$\n",

    "## Entry signal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our entry signal is dervied from the Z-score of the portfolio given, where the mean and standard deviation are derived from a fix (but probably rolling) window, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Z-score}^i = \\frac{\\Pi^t - \\bar{\\Pi^i}}{\\sigma_{\\Pi^i}}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "We would enter a trade for $\\text{Z-score} \\geq |2|$ two or more standar deviation events. \n",
